# Customer-Churn-Model
Evaluate the causes of customer churn and create a machine learning algorithm to predict potential trends

## Background
For our culminating project, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of customer churn data pertaining to an ecommerce firm. Our investigation encompassed an in-depth examination of various factors, including demographics, purchase behavior, and usage preferences. By evaluating these variables alongside additional pertinent factors, we sought to uncover their relationship with customer churn through the utilization of machine learning.

## Methodology 

First, we scrubbed our dataset from Kaggle,  Next, we integrated census data into our analysis to gain additional insights into the demographic characteristics of the customer base. By combining the census data with the customer churn dataset, we were able to establish a more comprehensive understanding of how demographics influenced churn.

We then utilized AWS to upload and store the scrubbed dataset 

To visualize the key factors identified in the data, we employed  Matplotlib. This allowed us to easily visualize the relationships between various factors and customer churn. This gave us additional insights into what factors should be focused on when creating our models.

## Analysis 

Our initial analysis revealed a market penetration 0.98% with customer churn of 17.8%.
Based on the average personal income from our analysis we were able to extrapolate from census data that our market was Detroit.
